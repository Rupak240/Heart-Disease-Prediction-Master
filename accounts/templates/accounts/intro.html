                        <p class="long-copy">Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart.
                          Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary
                          artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you’re born with
                          (congenital heart defects), among others. <br><br>The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably
                          with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions
                          that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain
                          (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle,
                          valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br><br>
                        <strong class="bold">About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.1
                          Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to
                          heart disease in 2009 were in men.<br>
                          <br>Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.<br>
                          <br>Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000
                          happen in people who have already had a heart attack.</strong><br>

                          <br>This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.<br>
                          <br>Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.<br>
                          <br>In this project, we will be applying Machine Learning algorithms included <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html" target="_blank">SupportVectorClassifier</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html" target="_blank">DecisionTreeClassifier</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html" target="_blank" >LogisticRegression</a> , <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html" target="_blank">NaiveBayesClassifier</a>, <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html" target="_blank">XgBoostClassifier</a>  and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html" target="_blank">RandomForestClassifier</a> for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, using a dataset.

                                <p class="long-copy">Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with approximately
                                a tripling of risk with each decade of life. Coronary fatty streaks can begin to form in adolescence.
                                It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 and older.
                                Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.</p>

                                  Once past menopause, it has been argued that a woman’s risk is similar to a man’s although
                                  more recent data from the WHO and UN disputes this. If a female has diabetes, she is more

                                <p class="long-copy">Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn’t get
                                  enough oxygen-rich blood. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The discomfort
                                  also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.</p>

                                <p class="long-copy">Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart.
                                   High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol
                                   or diabetes, increases your risk even more.</p>

                                  is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your
                                   diet, also ups your risk of a heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
                                   cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol) lowers your risk of a heart attack.</p>

                                  responding to insulin properly causes your body’s blood sugar levels to rise, increasing your

                                  moderate certainty that the potential harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG equal or
                                  exceed the potential benefits. For people at intermediate to high risk, current evidence is
                                  insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening.</p>

                                  of heart rate, was comparable to the increase in risk observed with high blood pressure.
                                  It has been shown that an increase in heart rate by 10 beats per minute was associated with
                                  an increase in the risk of cardiac death by at least 20%, and this increase in the risk is
                                  similar to the one observed with an increase in systolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg.</p>

                                   is a major cause.In unstable coronary artery disease, ST-segment depression is associated with
                                   a 100% increase in the occurrence of three-vessel/left main disease and to an increased risk of
                                   subsequent cardiac events. In these patients an early invasive strategy substantially decreases

                                <p class="long-copy">A treadmill ECG stress test is considered abnormal when there is a horizontal
                                   or down-sloping ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm at 60–80 ms after the J point. Exercise ECGs with
                                   up-sloping ST-segment depressions are typically reported as an ‘equivocal’ test. In general, the
                                   occurrence of horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression at a lower workload (calculated in METs)
                                   or heart rate indicates a worse prognosis and higher likelihood of multi-vessel disease. The duration
                                   of ST-segment depression is also important, as prolonged recovery after peak stress is consistent
                                   with a positive treadmill ECG stress test. Another finding that is highly indicative of significant
                                   CAD is the occurrence of ST-segment elevation > 1 mm (often suggesting transmural ischemia);
                                   these patients are frequently referred urgently for coronary angiography.</p>
